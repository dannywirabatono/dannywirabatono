# 📚 Projects
Design and Implementation of ISPU Calculation to Identify Air Quality and Its Impacts Based on IoT

Duration: Nov 2016 – May 2017
Institution: Institut Teknologi Telkom
This project developed a real‐time IoT-based air quality monitoring system designed to detect, calculate, and analyze pollution levels and their environmental impacts.
The system used gas sensors, a microcontroller, and an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module to transmit data to the ThingSpeak IoT platform. Data was processed and visualized using a custom Android application built with Java and Eclipse (JDT). The app supported manual and automated data retrieval and was validated across Android versions 4.4–6.0.1.
Software testing covered black-box, white-box, and basis path testing to ensure accurate ISPU (Air Pollution Standard Index) calculations and application reliability.
Key Technologies: Java, Android SDK, ThingSpeak IoT Platform, ESP8266, Microcontrollers, Eclipse JDT, Wireless Communication, Real-time Data Processing, Black-box & White-box Testing
